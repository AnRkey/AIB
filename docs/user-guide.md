### Interface Overview

The AIB interface consists of the following components:

- **Left Sidebar**: Contains buttons for accessing different AI services (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Grok)
- **Tab Bar**: Shows open tabs with website names and favicons
- **"+" Button**: Appears after opening the first tab, allows creating additional tabs
- **Right Controls**:
  - **+Window**: Opens a new instance of AIB
  - **AOT**: Toggles "Always on Top" mode to keep AIB visible over other windows

## Using AIB

### Working with Tabs

- **Opening a New Tab**: Click on any AI service button in the left sidebar
- **Creating Additional Tabs**: Click the "+" button in the tab bar
- **Switching Between Tabs**: Click on any tab to make it active
- **Closing a Tab**: Click the "Ã—" button on the right side of a tab
- **Scrolling Tabs**: If you have many tabs open, use the "<" and ">" buttons to scroll through them

### Feature Usage

#### Multiple AI Services
You can have different AI services open simultaneously in different tabs, making it easy to compare responses or work with multiple services at once.

#### Always on Top Mode
The "AOT" button in the top-right corner toggles "Always on Top" mode. When active (button highlighted), the AIB window will stay on top of other windows, making it easy to reference AI responses while working in other applications.

#### Multiple Instances
The "+Window" button opens a new instance of AIB, allowing you to organize your AI interactions in separate windows. Each instance operates independently.

## Tips and Tricks

1. **Comparing AI Responses**: Open different AI services in separate tabs to easily compare their responses to the same prompt.

2. **Quick Reference**: Use "Always on Top" mode to keep AIB visible while working in other applications, perfect for following instructions or referencing information.

3. **Organization by Task**: Use multiple instances of AIB to separate different projects or tasks, keeping your AI interactions organized.

4. **Tab Management**: Close tabs you're no longer using to keep the interface clean and reduce resource usage.

5. **Browser Compatibility**: AIB identifies as Chrome 134 to all websites, ensuring optimal compatibility with AI services and avoiding "unsupported browser" messages.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **AI Service Not Loading**
   - Ensure you have an active internet connection
   - Verify that you have an account for the service and are logged in
   - Try refreshing the tab or reopening the service in a new tab

2. **Performance Issues**
   - Close unused tabs to free up resources
   - Restart the application if it becomes sluggish after extended use

3. **Login Issues**
   - AIB uses your system's persistent storage for cookies, so you should stay logged in to services between sessions
   - If you're repeatedly asked to log in, check if your browser's cookies are being cleared automatically
